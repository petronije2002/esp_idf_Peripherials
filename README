# PeripheralLibrary

**PeripheralLibrary** is a reusable library for abstracting ESP32 peripherals, making it easy to use various functionalities like SPI, MCPWM, ADC, and others.

## Features

- **SPI**: Simplifies SPI communication with peripherals like the AS5048A encoder.
- **AS5048A**: Provides methods to read raw angle data and compute the angle in degrees.
- **MCPWM**: Abstracts motor control PWM generation.
- **ADC**: Provides easy methods for analog-to-digital conversion and voltage scaling.

## Installation

Place the `PeripheralLibrary` folder inside the `lib/` directory of your PlatformIO project.
